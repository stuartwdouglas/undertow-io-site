        <p>This is the design document for the undertow web server. It covers general
      architecture and design considerations, it is not a requirements document.</p>

        <h3 id="_overview">Overview</h3>
        
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>The core Undertow architecture is based on the concept of lightweight async
      handlers. These handlers are chained together to form a complete HTTP server.
      The handlers can also hand off to blocking handlers backed by a thread pool.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>This architecture is designed to give the end user complete flexibility when
      configuring the server. For instance if the user simply wants to server up
      static files, then they can confiure a server with only the handlers that are
      required for that task.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>An example handler chain could be as follows:</p>

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>Servlet functionality will be built on top of the async server core. The
      servlet module will integrate with the core by providing its own handlers for
      servlet specific functionality. As much as possible the servlet implementation
      will use async handlers, only changing to blocking handlers when absolutly
      required. This means that static resources packaged in a servlet will be
      served up via async IO.</p>

      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>Standard HTTP requests come into the server via the HTTPOpenListener, which
      wraps the channel in a PushBackStreamChannel and then hands off to the
      HTTPReadListener. The HTTPReadListener parses the request as it comes in, and
      once it has read all headers it creates a HTTPServerExchange and invokes the
      root handler. Any of the content body / next request that is read by this
      listener is pushed back onto the stream.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>The HTTP parsing is done by a bytecode generated state machine, that
      recognizes common headers and verbs. This means that parsing of common
      headers can be done more quickly and with less memory usage, as if the header
      value is known to the state machine an interned version of the string will be
      returned directly, with no need to allocate a String or a StringBuilder.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> It has not been shown yet if this will provide a significant
      performance boost with a real workload. If not then we may want to move to a
      simpler parser to avoid the extra complexity.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>Other protocols such as HTTPS, AJP and SPDY etc support will be provided

      details of the underlying protocol to the handlers.</p>

        <h3 id="_handlers">Handlers</h3>
        
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>The basic handler interface is as follows:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="listingblock">
        
        <div class="content monospaced">
          
          <pre class="highlight"><code class="java">public interface HttpHandler {&#x000A;  /**&#x000A;   * Handle the request.&#x000A;   *&#x000A;   * @param exchange the HTTP request/response exchange&#x000A;   */&#x000A;   void handleRequest(HttpServerExchange exchange) throws Exception;&#x000A;}</code></pre>
          
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>The HttpServerExchange holds all current state to do with this request and the
      response, including headers, response code, channels, etc. It can have
      arbitrary attachments added to it, to allow handlers to attach objects to be
      read by handlers later in the chain (for instance an Authentication handler
      could attach the authenticated identity, which may then be used by a later
      authorization handler to decide if the user should be able to access the
      resource).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>The HttpCompletionHandler is invoked when the request is completed. Any
      handlers that require a cleanup action of some sort map wrap this instance
      before passing it to the next handler. As these are asynchronous handlers the
      call chain may return while the request is still running, so it is not
      possible to cleanup in a finally block (in fact handlers should generally not
      run any code after invoking the next handler).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>Initially the handlers are invoked in the XNIO read thread. This means that
      they must not perform any potentially blocking operations, as this will leave
      the server unable to process other requests until the write thread returns.
      Instead handlers should either use asynchronous operations that allow for
      callbacks, or delegate the task to a thread pool (such as the XNIO worker
      pool).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>The request and response streams may be wrapped by a handler, by registering a
      ChannelWrapper with the HttpServerExchange. This wrapping will generally only
      be used by handlers that implement a transfer or a content encoding. For
      instance to implement compression a handler would register a ChannelWrapper
      that compresses any data that passes through it, and writes the compressed
      data to the underlying channel. Note that these wrappers are only used to
      write out the response body, they cannot be used to change the way the status
      line and headers are written out.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>Only a single handler can responsible for reading the request or writing the
      body. If a handler attempts to get channel after another handler has already
      grabbed it then null will be returned.</p>

      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>Persistent connections are implemented by wrapping the request and response
      channels with either a chunking or fixed length channel. Once the request has
      been fully read the next request can be started immediately, with the next
      response being provided with a gated stream that will not allow the response
      to start until the current response is finished.</p>

      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>Sessions will be implemented with a SessionHandler. When a request is
      processed this handler will check for an existing session cookie, if it is
      found it will retrieve the session from the session manager, and attach it to
      the HttpServerExchange. It will also attach the SessionManager to the
      HttpServerExchange. Retrieving the session may require an asynchronous
      operation (e.g. if the session is stored in a database, or located on another
      node in the cluster).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>Once the Session and SessionManager are attached to the exchange later handler
      can store data in the session, or use the session manager to create a new
      session if one does not already exist.</p>

      programatically configured by assembling handler chains. XML configuration
      will be provided by the AS7 subsystem. This allows the server to be used in an
      embedded mode without any XML configuration. In order to provide a standalone
      servlet container to compete with Tomcat and Jetty we will use a cut down AS7
      instance, that just provides the web subsystem. This will mean that users
      will get all the AS7 benefits (modules, management etc) with a smaller
      download and a container that is perceived as being more lightweight than a
      full AS7 instance.</p>

      and that any existing <tt>SecurityContext</tt> is removed.  As the call returns later this handler
      is also responsible for removing the <tt>SecurityContext</tt> that was set and restoring the one remove.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>The <tt>SecurityContext</tt> is responsible for both holding the state related to the currently authenticated user
      and also for holding the configured <tt>AuthenticationMechanism`s and providing methods to work with both of
      these.  As this `SecurityContext</tt> is replacable and restorable then advanced configurations can be
      achieve where a general configuration can be applied to a complete server with custom configuration
      replacing it later in the call.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>After the <tt>SecurityContext</tt> has been established subseqeunt handlers can then add <tt>AuthenticationMechanism`s
      to the context, to simplify this Undertow contains a handler called `AuthenticationMechanismsHandler</tt>
      this handler can be created with a set of <tt>AuthenticationMechanism`s and will set them all on the
      established `SecurityContext</tt>.  Alternatively custom handlers could be used to add mechanisms one at a time
      bases on alternative requirements.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>The next handler in the authentication process is the <tt>AuthenticationConstraintHandler</tt>, this handler is
      responsible for checking the current request and identifying if authentication should be marked as being
      required for the current request.  The default implementation marks authentication as being required for
      all requests that it handles - the handler can be extended and the <tt>isAuthenticationRequired</tt> method
      overriden to provide more complex checks.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>The final handler in this chain is the <tt>AuthenticationCallHandler</tt>, this handler is responsible for
      ensuring the <tt>SecurityContext</tt> is called to actually perform the authentication process, depending
      on any identified constraint this will either mandate authentication or only perform authentication
      if appropriate for the configured mechanisms.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>There is no requirement for these handlers to be executed consecutively, the only requirement is that first
      the <tt>SecurityContext</tt> is established, then the <tt>AuthenticationMechanism`s and constrain check can be
      performed in any order and finally the `AuthenticationCallHandler</tt> but be called before any processing of
      a potentially protected resource.</p>

        <p>The <tt>AuthenticationResult</tt> is used by the mechanism to indicate the status of the attempted authentication and

        <p>The authentication process is split into two phases, the <tt>INBOUND</tt> phase and the <tt>OUTBOUND</tt> phase, the
      <tt>INBOUND</tt> phase is only responsible for checking if authentication data has been received from the client
      and using to attempt authentication if and only if it has been provided.  During the <tt>INBOUND</tt> phase the
      mechanisms are called sequentally (if we wanted to support multiple mechanisms succeeding concurently
      we could also execute these concurently although that would lead to multiple threads per request) -
      a mechanism is caled in this phase by a call to <tt>authenticate</tt>.</p>

      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>When the <tt>authenticate</tt> method of the <tt>AuthenticationMechanism</tt> is called the outcome is indicated
      using an <tt>AuthenticationResult</tt> with an <tt>AuthenticationOutcome</tt> of one of the following: -</p>
      </div>
      <div class="ulist">
        
        <ul>
        
          <li>
            <p><strong>AUTHENTICATED</strong> - The mechanism has successfully authenticated the remote user.</p>
            
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <p><strong>NOT_ATTEMPTED</strong> - The mechanism saw no applicable security tokens so did not attempt to authenticate the user.</p>
            
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <p><strong>NOT_AUTHENTICATED</strong> - The mechanism attempted authentication but it either failed or requires an additional round trip to the client.</p>

        </ul>

      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>If the <tt>AuthenticationOutcome</tt> is <tt>AUTHENTICATE</tt> then a <tt>Principal</tt> must also be returned in the <tt>AuthenticationResult</tt>, the remaining
      outcomes will not have a <tt>Principal</tt> to return.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>The overall authentication process using the mechanisms run as follows: -</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>Regardless of if authentication has been flagged as being required when the request reaches the <tt>AuthenticationCallHandler</tt> the
      <tt>SecurityContext</tt> is called to commence the process.  The reason this happens regardless of if authentication is flagged as
      required is for a few reasons: -
      1 - The client may have sent additional authentication tokens and have expectations the response will take these into account.
      2 - We may be able to verify the remote user without any additional rount trips, especially where authentication has already occurred.
      3 - The authentication mechanism may need to pass intermediate updates to the client so we need to ensure any inbound tokens are valid.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>When authentication runs the <tt>authenticate</tt> method on each configured <tt>AuthenticationMechanism</tt> is called in turn, this continues
      untill one of the following occurs: -</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>1 - A mechanisms successfully authenticates the request and returns <tt>AUTHENTICATED</tt>.
      2 - A mechanism attempts but does not complete authentication and returns <tt>NOT_AUTHENTICATED</tt>.
      3 - The list of mechanisms is exhausted.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>At this point if the response was <tt>AUTHENTICATED</tt> then the request will be allowed through and passed onto the next handler.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>If the request is <tt>NOT_AUTHENTICATED</tt> then either authentication failed or a mechanism requires an additional round trip with the
      client, either way the <tt>handleComplete</tt> method of each defined <tt>AuthenticationMethod</tt> is called in turn and the response sent back
      to the client.  All mechanisms are called as even if one mechanism is mid-authentication the client can still decide to abandon
      that mechanism and switch to an alternative mechanism so all challenges need to be re-sent.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>If the list of mechanisms was exhausted then the previously set authentication constraint needs to be checked, if authentication was
      not required then the request can proceed to the next handler in the chain and that will be then of authentication for this request
      (unless a later handler mandates authentication and requests authentication is re-atempted).  If however authentication was required
      then as with a <tt>NOT_AUTHENTICATED</tt> response each mechanism has <tt>handleComplete</tt> called in turn to generate an authentication challenge
      to send to the client.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>If request processing after calling the mechanisms is allowed through to the next handler and if no mechanism authenticated the
      incomming requests then the mechanisms are not called in the <tt>OUTBOUND</tt> phase - however if an <tt>AuthenticationMechanism</tt> did
      authenticate the client then regardless of if this was flagged as required the <tt>handleComplete</tt> method of that mechanism and only
      that mechanism will be called.  The purpose of this is in case the mechanism needs to send further mechanism specific tokens
      back to the client.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          
        <p>A mechanism can make the following call within the <tt>handleComplete</tt> method to check if it should be sending back a general
